# Titan CCP - Common

The [Titan Control Center Prototype](http://eprints.uni-kiel.de/43910) (CCP) is a
scalable monitoring infrastructure for [Industrial DevOps](https://industrial-devops.org/).
It allows to monitor, analyze and visualize the electrical power consumption of
devices and machines in production environments such as factories.

This repository contains common library code and record definitions for all microservices of the Titan CCP.

## Build

We use Gradle as a build tool. In order to build the project run
`./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS or `./gradlew.bat build` on Windows.
